# About Me

Bonjour! My name is Abhishek Murti. I pursued my Bachelor's degree from BITS, Pilani in India, and then obtained my Master's degree from Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, in Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering. Due to limited  hand-eye coordination and a lack of interest in wet lab work, I've always gravitated towards computational work. Back in undergrad, it used to be Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), but during my Master's (and ever since), it has been Computational Biology. My Master's thesis was focused on developing ODE and constraint-based mathematical models in cell-free systems, a systems biology approach to solving biological problems.

I currently work as a data scientist/bioinformatician at the University of California, San Francisco. Our research focus is on comprehending the molecular and cellular mechanisms responsible for maintaining the liver under varying health and disease conditions. My role involves transforming sequencing data, with a predominant emphasis on single-cell, single-nuclei, and spatial transcriptomics data, into meaningful mathematical representations. Additionally, I am involved in implementing and developing bioinformatic pipelines for downstream analysis.

### Here is an unordered list:

*   Item foo
*   Item bar
*   Item baz
*   Item zip

### And an ordered list:

1.  Item one
1.  Item two
1.  Item three
1.  Item four

### And a nested list:

- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
    - level 3 item
    - level 3 item
