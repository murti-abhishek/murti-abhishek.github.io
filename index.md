# About Me

Hi, I‚Äôm **Abhishek Murti** ‚Äî a computational biologist with a background in Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering. I completed my undergraduate degree at BITS Pilani (India) and my Master's at Cornell University in Ithaca, NY, where I transitioned from computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to computational biology.

My Master's thesis focused on systems biology, specifically developing ODE-based and constraint-based mathematical models of cell-free systems. Since then, I‚Äôve remained deeply engaged in computational work, particularly in high-dimensional transcriptomics.

I currently work as a **bioinformatician at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF)**. My work centers on:
- Single-cell and single-nuclei RNA sequencing
- Spatial transcriptomics
- Multi-omics data integration

I build scalable bioinformatics pipelines and develop computational tools to help uncover the molecular and cellular mechanisms driving liver health and disease, from autoimmune hepatitis to pediatric liver cancer.

# Personal Projects

### üì¶ Julia Package for Single-Cell Analysis
Developed a lightweight Julia package for analyzing single-cell transcriptomics data. The toolkit includes functionality for clustering, dimensionality reduction, visualization, and marker gene identification ‚Äî inspired by Scanpy and Seurat, but designed for high performance and flexibility in Julia.

### üß† AI Scientist Prototype  
Building a prototype LLM-powered agent that generates mechanistic hypotheses from tumor transcriptomics data using gene signatures, clustering, and literature context.

# UCSF Projects
### üî¨ Hepatoblastoma Tumor Atlas  
Developing single-cell and single-nuclei atlases from fresh and frozen tumor samples to identify distinct tumor subtypes and transcriptional programs driving heterogeneity in high-risk pediatric liver cancer.

### üß¨ Autoimmune Hepatitis (AIH)  
Characterizing periportal hepatocyte damage and immune interactions using snRNA-seq of human liver biopsies. Identified potential autoantigens and CD40/CD40L signaling axes driving pathology.
